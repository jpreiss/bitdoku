Non-brute-force Sudoku solver

* * *

I'm aiming to write a Sudoku solver that replicates my thought process when I'm solving Sudoku on paper.
I'm a mediocre Sudoku player, so I will have to learn a lot of techniques to pass the full test suite.
I have chosen to use the first 9 bits of an integer to represent the possiblities at each cell, 
and I am having fun with bitwise operations.

Test suite thanks to **ruud** on http://forum.enjoysudoku.com/benchmark-sudoku-list-t3834.html.
